This directory contains a hard fork from the amazing [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) project.
We choose to do a hard fork because we wanted to
 - Include AirSim in a bigger project where AirSim is tightly integrated
 - Do a lot of changes in a verry short time
 - Not be slowed down by git submodule problems
Since we are not planning to keep this fork up to date with upstream or pr changes here to upstream we see no big disadvantages.

This fork was based on origin microsoft/AirSim commit 1cef6f2c60735a74a6e8d5f443e5384aba135b12

All irrelevant code to this project has been removed so new developres only see code that is actually in use.

Relevant documentation has been moved to /docs, all other tutorials and docs have been deleted.
