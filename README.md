This is a Formula Student Driverless Simulation Competition System. (FSDS)
It will provide a virtual environment where Autonomous Systems from different Formula Student teams can compete in time-trial challenges. 
The first competition will take place during the driverless event, FS-Online 2020.

FSDS is brought to you by your friends at Formula Student Team Delft, MIT Driverless and FSEast.

You can read all about how FSDS works in this [systems overview document](/docs/system-overview.md)

## Repo Overview

`/UE4Project` is the Unreal Engine 4 project.
In here you will find everything that runs inside Unreal Engine.
This includes the world, all assets and the AirSim server.
The AirSim server uses the AirLib shared code (see `/AirSim/AirLib`).

`/Simulator` is the simulation control system. This is a ROS workspace.
The simulator provides a ROS bridge between the autonomous systems and the simulation, offers a web gui for officials to control the simulation and connects to the virtual world inside Unreal Engine.

`/AirSim` is a slimmed-down, hard-fork of the [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) project.
There is only code located that is shared between Simulator and UE4 plugin.
When AirSim is compiled, the AirLib binaries are placed within `/UE4Project/Plugins/AirSim/Source/AirLib`.

This repo uses LFS for some large files. All files bigger than 90MB are added to LFS.

## Development

For developing within this repo you need quite a good computer because Unreal Engine is a heavy baby.
We highly recommend the following computer specs. You might be able to run with less power but everything will be slower.
* 8 core 3Ghz CPU
* 12 GB memory
* 100GB free SSD storage
* Recent NVidia card with Vulkan support and 3 GB of memory.

If you do not have access to such a computer, you can [set up a remote workstation in google cloud](docs/gcp-remote-workstation.md).

To actually setup your computer for development follow [this tutorial](docs/get-ready-to-develop.md).


## Credits
This project is based on the work of some amazing other open-source projects. 

Primarily, [the AirSim project built by Microsoft and many open-source contributors](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim). 
Without it, we could have never done this.

Many game assets like the surrounding world are based on assets from the [Formula Student Technion Driverless AirSim fork](https://github.com/FSTDriverless/AirSim). These assets made this project look as cool as it does now.
