# Formula Student Driverless Simulator ROS Bridge

Connects your ROS autonomous system to the FSDS!

A ROS wrapper over the AirSim C++ **Car** client library. This code is based on the [original AirSim ROS wrapper for the *Multirotor* API](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/tree/master/ros/src/airsim_ros_interface) and provides an interface between AirSim + Unreal Engine and your ROS-based autonomous system. 

For more documentation, please consult this [page](../../../docs/ros-bridge.md).
