                <h1 id="custom-mapping">Custom Mapping</h1>
<h2 id="making-custom-maps">Making custom maps</h2>
<p>You can make your own custom map by using the <a href="#custom-map-file-format">following format below</a> or by using the <a href="https://github.com/mvanlobensels/random-track-generator">random track generator</a> from @mvanlobensels that now has the posibility to export maps for FSDS</p>
<h2 id="loading-custom-maps">Loading custom maps</h2>
<h3 id="from-the-gui">From the GUI</h3>
<p>Open the simulator and in the "Level" drop down select "CustomMap". 
Paste the absolute path to your map in the text field that showed up and run the simulator.</p>
<p><img alt="droneport track" src="../images/FEB_droneport_track.png" /></p>
<p>To load a new map, restart the simulator and give it a new absolute path to the new map.</p>
<h3 id="from-command-line">From command line</h3>
<p>When launching the simulator executable, add the absolute path to the map as a command line argument:</p>
<p><code>"$UE4_PROJECT_ROOT/FSOnline/Binaries/Linux/Blocks" FSOnline -CustomMapPath="&lt;path to the custom map here&gt;"</code></p>
<p>The simulator will launch directly into the custom map, skipping the menu entirely.</p>
<h2 id="custom-map-file-format">Custom map file format</h2>
<p>The maps need to be made in a specific format. We chose to use csv files.
The format within the csv files will have to look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>tag,x,y,direction,x_variance,y_variance,xy_covariance
</code></pre>
<p>for now the <code>x_variance</code>, <code>y_variance</code> and <code>xy_covariance</code> are not used and can be 0.</p>
<p>Possible tags are:
- blue
- yellow
- big_orange</p>
<p>As an example, your file could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>blue,47.96037109,83.400,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
yellow,67.96037109,83.400,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
big_orange,20.9,-13.8,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
big_orange,16.4,-21.6,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
big_orange,20.0,-13.3,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
big_orange,15.5,-21.1,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
blue,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
yellow,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
blue,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
yellow,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
blue,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
yellow,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to either have 4 or 2 big orange cones to make sure that we can calculate how the start finish line should be oriented.</p>
<h2 id="share-it-with-the-community">Share it with the community</h2>
<p>You are welcome to share your maps with the community by adding them to the <code>maps</code> folder and creating a pull request.</p>
