# Formula Student Driverless Simulator

Welcome to the FSDS documentation.

This home page contains an index with a brief description of the different sections in the documentation. 
Feel free to read in whatever order preferred. 
In any case, here are a few suggestions for newcomers.

* **Get familiar with the architecture.** The [system overview](system-overview.md) introduces you to the ideas and concepts of the system.
* **Run the simulation.** Either follow the [simulation guide](how-to-simulate.md) or build from source by following the [development guide](how-to-develop.md)
* **Integrate ROS.** [Build the ros bridge node](building-ros.md) and [launch the ros bridge](ros-bridge.md)
